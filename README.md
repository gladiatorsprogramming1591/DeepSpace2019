## Who are we?
The Greece Gladiators are a First Robotics Team based out of the [Greece Central School District](https://www.greececsd.org/) in upstate NY. All four schools in our district combine to form one team, made up of students specializing in mechanical, electrical, marketing, CAD, and programming skills.
The programmers of the Greece Gladiators are; 
Mentor Jeff Tuttle, Dylan Tompkins, Kenan Celik, and Andrew DelRegno

## What Does Our Robot Do?
Our 2019 robot uses a mecanum drive train in conjunction with an elevator and claw system to pick up hatches and accurately place them on the cargo ship and up to level 2 on the rocket using a Rasperry PI vision coprocessor. It also has the ability to move balls from the loading station to the cargo ship. For an in depth analysis of the individual subsystems and the code that goes along with them, visit [our wiki](https://github.com/gladiatorsprogramming1591/DeepSpace2019/wiki).
